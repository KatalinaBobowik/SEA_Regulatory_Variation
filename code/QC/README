# Quality control steps

This folder contains scripts for perfomring some basic quality control steps on the raw RNA-seq data, located on Spartan under /data/cephfs/punim0586/shared/raw_data (indoRNA for batch 1, indoRNA_second_batch for batch 2, indoRNA_third_batch for batch 3, and indoRNA_no_globin for the globin samples). 

## md5sums

In order to check if MD5 sums were the same between our downloaded files and Macrogen's file, MD% sums were checked as follows:

# cd into raw data folder, execute md5sums on all files, then save as text file
md5sum * >> /vlsci/SG0008/kbobowik/Sumba/ReferenceFiles/indoPapua/md5sums/md5sums_indoRNA.txt
sort md5sums_indoRNA.txt > md5sums_indoRNA_sorted.txt

# sort md5sum file from Macrogen and get total number of matching lines between our own MD5 sum file and Macrogen's MD5 sum file
sort md5sums_Macrogen_sorted.txt > md5sums_Macrogen_sorted.txt
awk 'FNR==NR { a[$1]; next } $1 in a { c++ } END { print c }' md5sums_indoRNA_sorted.txt md5sums_Macrogen_sorted.txt

## FastQC

For the first quality control step, FastQC was run in order to ensure there were no major problems in the data that might affect downstream analyses. 
FastQC v0.11.5 for Linux was downlaoded from Babraham Bioninformatics: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html#fastqc. FastQC quality check was performed on both globin-depleted (primary data) and globin samples (free, test data).

On all samples, FastQC is run twice: once for an initial sample QC check and a second time after trimming. In this script, a summary file is also made from the FastQC output, however MultiQC is also used for summary information. 

## Trimmomatic

Trimmomatic, version 0.36, was downlaoded from binary at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic. All information on parameters can be found in the Trimmomatic manual: http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf

Leading and trailing bases are removed if below a quality of 20 and the minimum length is kept at 90 bp (i.e., in the Trimmomatic terminology: LEADING:20 TRAILING:20 MINLEN:90). 

This script was run for all samples as an array script using sbatch. All shell scripts can be found on Spartan under the path '/data/cephfs/punim0586/kbobowik/Sumba/scripts/shell_scripts' with 'FastQC' and 'Trimmomatic' prefix.
