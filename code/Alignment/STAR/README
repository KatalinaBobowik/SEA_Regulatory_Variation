# Mapping Reads using STAR

The scripts in this folder were made in order to map reads (post QC/trimming) to the human and plasmodium genome using the genome aligner STAR.

Star version 2.5.3a was downloaded from github: https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/releases. The STAR manual can be found here: http://labshare.cshl.edu/shares/gingeraslab/www-data/dobin/STAR/STAR.posix/doc/STARmanual.pdf

Two-pass mapping parameters were followed as in GATK protocol for Calling Variants in RNASeq (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article.php?id=3891) as well as STAR manual: http://labshare.cshl.edu/shares/gingeraslab/www-data/dobin/STAR/STAR.posix/doc/STARmanual.pdf.

## Human genome
The human genome GrCh38, Ensembl release 90, was used for this analysis. The primary assembly was used, which contains all toplevel sequence regions excluding haplotypes and patches. 

After generating the genome, an array table is made for all samples for the first pass. Here, we're aligning all trimmed reads from the trimmomatic output (see script QC_Pipeline_indoPapuanSamples.sh) to the human genome fasta file. 

For the second pass, all of the SJ.out.tab files are combined from from all files created in first pass into one file (Followed as in google groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rna-star/9C3W_BMfGXM/-rg7C6HURHsJ)

For the output, the bam file is filtered so that only uniquely mapped reads remain. This is used by removing all the bitwise flags of 0x100 (not uniquely mapped).

## Plasmodium genome

The plasmodium falciparum genome 3d7 (along with the GFF file GFF files) was downloaded from Plasmo DB: http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/Pfalciparum3D7/fasta/data/PlasmoDB-36_Pfalciparum3D7_Genome.fasta

The plasmodium vivax genome (P01) was also downloaded from Plasmos DBL http://plasmodb.org/common/downloads/Current_Release/PvivaxP01/fasta/data/PlasmoDB-36_PvivaxP01_Genome.fasta

All scripts are run with sbatch and shell scripts for running this script on the server can be found on Spartan under '/data/cephfs/punim0586/kbobowik/Sumba/scripts/shell_scripts'.
